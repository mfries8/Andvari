# Andvari

> "That gold will be the death of whoever possesses it." — Andvari, probably right before his rocks got stolen.

## Overview
Andvari is an automated, multi-agent machine learning pipeline designed to find freshly fallen meteorites using high-resolution drone photogrammetry. Because wandering aimlessly through a desert looking for a dark rock among millions of slightly lighter rocks is an inefficient use of human knees. 

Heavily inspired by the methodologies of the Global Fireball Network (GFN), Andvari ingests aerial imagery, runs heavily augmented Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to identify meteorite proxies, aggressively filters false positives (shadows, rabbit droppings, and regular terrestrial dirt), and outputs high-precision GIS coordinates to vector field recovery teams.

## The Swarm Architecture
Andvari utilizes an agentic framework to optimize hardware utilization, keeping the CPU pegged with I/O and preprocessing while feeding the GPU an endless stream of tensors.

* **Supervisor:** Orchestrates the madness.
* **Slicer:** Chops 44MP aerial images into digestible, overlapping 512x512 tiles across all available CPU cores.
* **Augmenter:** Fine-tunes the model in the field using localized background data.
* **Inquisitor:** The GPU-bound CNN inference engine.
* **Skeptic:** The false-positive filter. Rotates candidates and enforces density caps to weed out anomalies.
* **Cartographer:** Translates pixel hits back to absolute Earth coordinates (Lat/Long).
* **Auditor:** Serves up a rapid-review UI for human verification before anyone actually goes for a hike.

## Prerequisites
* Python 3.10+
* A CUDA-capable GPU (RTX 2080 Ti equivalent or better required for field processing times)
* Fast NVMe storage (Do not run this off a spinning drive unless you enjoy waiting)
* A drone capable of flying grid searches at 1.5 - 2.0 mm/pixel GSD.

## Installation
